# PROJECT: "THE DEATH OF THE DIAMOND RECORD"

## A Deep Dive into the Global Best-Selling Albums of All Time

DATE: 15/01/2026

# "What makes an album transcend time? Is it the genre, the era, or the artist's origin?"

## The Challenge
Why do certain albums become cultural pillars while others fade? I analyzed a dataset of the world’s best-selling albums to identify the traits of a "Diamond" record.

# GENRE DOMINANCE

These visualization break down how Rock and Pop established a market monopoly during the peak vinyl and CD eras.

# THE ERA LOCK

I used a scatter plot of sales volume vs. release year to visualize the 'plateau' of modern music. It reveals how the shift from physical ownership to digital streaming changed the definition of a "best-seller."

# ARTIST EFFICIENCY

I calculated average sales per album to distinguish between "One-Hit Wonders" and artists with long-term commercial consistency.

# The "Hidden Story" Discovery

While performing my analysis, I uncovered a startling trend: The "Best-Sellers Club" is essentially closed. Despite the global reach of modern music, nearly all the top 50 best-selling albums of all time were released in the 1970s and 1980s. This project explores the "Golden Age" of sales and why modern superstars struggle to break into this historic leaderboard.
